Lousy Invaders 2
================

Years ago I taught myself Flash game development by making Lousy Invaders, a low-rent Galaga clone that took its poor self-esteem out on others. Now you can make browser games with HTML5, so I decided it was time to answer the clamoring for a sequel. It even works on your phone, sort of.
